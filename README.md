Workout-Trainer
===============

These python scripts loop through each exercise in the 7-minute workout so that each one is announced out loud, along with the time remaining until the next exercise. The purpose of these scripts is to enable someone to do the workout without having to keep track of time or continually check to see what the next exercise is. 

One script is written as the original 7-minute workout is intended, with each exercise lasting 30 seconds. The other script is written such that each exercise last one minute, extending the workout to be closer to 15 minutes long.
